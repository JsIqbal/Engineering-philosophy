SOLID
Single responsibility principle 
Open closed principle - open for implementation and closed for modification
Liskov Substitution - 
    Interface IsSearchInputProps extends React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>{
        isLarge?: boolean
    }

Interface Segragation - 
    export interface Iproduct {
        id: string;
        title: string
    }

inteface IproductProps {
    product: IProduct
}

one component should have its own interface of the particular props it uses so that all the interface properties are not imported directly.

Dependency Inversion: One entity should depend upon abstractions not concretions. DIP
